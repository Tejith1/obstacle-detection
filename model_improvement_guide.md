# ðŸš€ Model Performance Improvement Guide

## Current Issues & Solutions

### Why Detection Might Be Poor
1. **Training Data Quality**: Limited or poor quality training images
2. **Class Imbalance**: Some classes have fewer examples
3. **Lighting Conditions**: Model trained on specific lighting
4. **Camera Angle**: Training vs real-world camera perspectives
5. **Object Size**: Small objects harder to detect

## Immediate Improvements (No Retraining)

### 1. Optimize Detection Parameters
```python
# In webcam_detect.py - Try these settings
CONF_THRESH = 0.15      # Lower = more detections (was 0.25)
IOU_THRESH = 0.3        # Lower = less overlap filtering (was 0.45)
IMG_SIZE = 832          # Higher = better accuracy (was 640)
```

### 2. Multi-Scale Detection
```python
# Add to webcam_detect.py
def multi_scale_detect(model, img, sizes=[416, 640, 832]):
    """Run detection at multiple scales and combine results"""
    all_detections = []
    for size in sizes:
        # Resize and detect
        resized = letterbox(img, size, stride=stride)
        pred = model(resized)
        all_detections.append(pred)
    # Combine and filter results
    return combine_detections(all_detections)
```

### 3. Frame Averaging
```python
# Smooth detections across frames
detection_history = []
def smooth_detections(current_det, history_size=5):
    detection_history.append(current_det)
    if len(detection_history) > history_size:
        detection_history.pop(0)
    # Return averaged/filtered detections
    return filter_consistent_detections(detection_history)
```

## Long-term Improvements (Requires Retraining)

### 1. Data Augmentation
- **More training images**: Collect 500+ images per class
- **Diverse conditions**: Different lighting, angles, weather
- **Synthetic data**: Use simulation tools for drone perspectives

### 2. Transfer Learning
```python
# Use pre-trained COCO model as base
# Fine-tune on your specific obstacle classes
python train.py --weights yolov5s.pt --data your_data.yaml --epochs 100
```

### 3. Ensemble Methods
- Train multiple models with different architectures
- Combine predictions for better accuracy
